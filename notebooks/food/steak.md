## 3. Core Components of Steak

### 3.1 Beef Cuts

The cut determines tenderness, flavor, and ideal cooking method.

**Common Steak Cuts:**
- Ribeye
- Sirloin
- Tenderloin (Filet Mignon)
- T-bone
- Strip steak

**Key Factors:**
- Marbling (intramuscular fat)
- Muscle usage
- Thickness

Cuts with higher marbling generally offer greater flavor and juiciness.

### 3.2 Seasoning

Steak seasoning is intentionally minimal to preserve the natural flavor of the beef.

**Typical Seasonings:**
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Garlic
- Butter or herb infusions (optional)

Salt is essential for enhancing flavor and promoting surface browning.

### 3.3 Cooking Fat

Cooking fats influence flavor and heat transfer.

**Common Choices:**
- Butter
- Olive oil
- Beef tallow

High smoke-point fats are preferred for searing.

## 4. Preparation Process

### Step 1: Meat Selection
- Choose fresh, well-marbled cuts
- Allow steak to reach room temperature before cooking

### Step 2: Seasoning
- Season generously with salt and pepper
- Apply seasoning shortly before cooking or well in advance for dry brining

### Step 3: Searing
- Use high heat
- Develop a browned crust through the Maillard reaction

### Step 4: Cooking
- Grill, pan-sear, or broil
- Flip minimally to preserve moisture

### Step 5: Resting
- Rest the steak for 5–10 minutes
- Allows juices to redistribute evenly

## 5. Doneness Levels

Steak doneness affects texture and flavor.

**Common Levels:**
- Rare (cool red center)
- Medium rare (warm red center)
- Medium (pink center)
- Medium well (slight pink)
- Well done (fully cooked)

Medium rare is widely regarded as optimal for balancing tenderness and flavor.

## 6. Nutritional Considerations

Steak is nutrient-dense and protein-rich.

**Key Nutrients:**
- High-quality protein
