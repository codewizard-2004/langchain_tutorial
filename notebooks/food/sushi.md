# 🍣 Sushi — A Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Introduction

Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish centered on vinegared rice combined with seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Contrary to common misconception, sushi is defined by its seasoned rice rather than raw fish. Sushi represents precision, balance, and respect for ingredients, making it one of the most technically refined cuisines in the world.

## 2. Historical Background

The origins of sushi trace back to ancient preservation methods in Southeast Asia, where fish was fermented with rice to extend shelf life. This method evolved in Japan into *narezushi*, and later into *hayazushi*, which emphasized fresh consumption rather than fermentation.

By the Edo period, sushi transformed into a fast food style featuring fresh fish and vinegared rice, sold by street vendors in Tokyo. Over time, sushi spread globally, adapting to local tastes while preserving its core principles.
