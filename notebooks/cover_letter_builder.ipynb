    "* User uploads Resume (PDF/DOCX → parsed into text).\n",
    "* User pastes Job Description (JD).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keyword Extraction (LangChain pipeline #1)\n",
    "* Use an LLM + PydanticOutputParser to extract:\n",
    "    - role (e.g., \"Data Scientist\")\n",
    "    - seniority (e.g., \"Mid-level\")\n",
    "    - must_have (e.g., Python, SQL, Machine Learning)\n",
    "    - nice_to_have (e.g., Cloud, Docker, NLP)\n",
    "    - tools (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Tableau)\n",
    "✅ Output = structured JDKeywords object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resume Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parse the resume into sections: Experience, Skills, Projects, Education.\n",
    "* Extract skills & experiences → again with a structured schema (e.g., ResumeProfile).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Keyword Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare JD keywords vs Resume keywords.\n",
    "* Mark:\n",
    "    - ✅ Matches (strengths to emphasize).\n",
    "    - ❌ Gaps (skills missing → handled carefully, not overclaimed).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cover Letter Generation (LangChain pipeline #2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prompt template uses:\n",
    "    - JDKeywords (so letter aligns with employer’s needs).\n",
    "    - ResumeProfile (so letter emphasizes relevant experience).\n",
    "    - LLM writes a personalized cover letter, structured into:\n",
    "    - Greeting\n",
    "    - Hook (why the candidate is interested in this role/company)\n",
    "    - Body (match candidate’s experience → JD requirements)\n",
    "    - Closing (enthusiasm + call to action)."

      "Dear InnovateTech Solutions Hiring Team,\n",
      "\n",
      "I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Senior Full-Stack Developer position at InnovateTech Solutions, as advertised. With over five years of experience in full-stack development, including a recent role as a Senior Software Engineer, I am confident that my skills and experience align perfectly with the requirements of this role.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my current role at TechNova Inc., I have led the end-to-end development of complex B2B SaaS applications, including the architectural design and successful migration of a legacy monolithic Django application to a scalable microservices architecture. I have also designed and implemented robust CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Terraform on AWS, significantly streamlining deployment processes. My experience also includes mentoring junior developers and collaborating effectively within Agile/Scrum methodologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "My technical expertise spans across the full stack, with strong proficiency in JavaScript (ES6+), React, Redux, and modern build tools like Webpack and Vite for front-end development. On the back end, I am highly skilled in Python, Django, Django REST Framework, and FastAPI, coupled with extensive experience in PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery for robust data management and task queuing. I am adept at designing and implementing RESTful APIs, ensuring scalable and efficient communication between services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I possess hands-on experience with cloud platforms such as AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda), containerization with Docker, and developing automated CI/CD workflows. I am also proficient in TypeScript, Jest, and Cypress for comprehensive testing, and familiar with collaborative tools like Git, Jira, Confluence, and Slack.\n",
      "\n",
      "My GitHub profile (github.com/jchen-dev) showcases relevant projects, including a CI/CD Pipeline Automator that demonstrates my practical application of Docker and GitHub Actions for automated deployments. I am eager to bring my expertise in building high-performance, scalable applications to InnovateTech Solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your team.\n",
