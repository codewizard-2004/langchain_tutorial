Developers are now building sophisticated applications that can reason, access external data, and perform complex tasks. Three fundamental concepts at the heart of this revolution are **LangChain**, **Embeddings**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Understanding how these technologies work together is key to unlocking the full potential of AI.'),\n",
